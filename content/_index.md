## Why I'm Different

**I think strategically with you.** Before writing code, I help you cut through the noise. What's core? What's nice-to-have? We refine the scope to the essence of your vision.

**I'm a builder, not a consultant.** No strategy decks. No endless meetings. Just working software delivered fast.

**20 years of product thinking.** I've built enough to know what works and what doesn't. I'll tell you honestly what to build and what to skip.

**I build fast.** Using modern AI tooling (Claude Code) + deep experience = 3-5x faster than traditional development. That speed advantage goes to you.

## FAQ

**Q: Can you maintain it after delivery?**
A: No. I build and hand off. You own the code, you run it. I can recommend freelancers if needed.

**Q: What if I need changes after delivery?**
A: 2 revision rounds are included (scope-limited). After that, you're on your own or we negotiate a new scope.

**Q: What if it takes longer than 10 days?**
A: I buffer for this. If scope is properly defined, 10 days is realistic. Worst case: 12 days.

**Q: Do you sign NDAs?**
A: Yes, standard NDAs are fine.

**Q: What's your tech stack?**
A: Python/JavaScript/PHP, modern AI APIs, simple architectures. No overengineering.

**Q: Can you work with our existing codebase?**
A: Maybe. I need to review it first. If it's a mess, I'll tell you upfront (and probably decline).
