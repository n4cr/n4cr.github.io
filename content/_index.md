title: "I Build AI MVPs in 10 Days"
description: "I build AI MVPs in 10 days and business automation in 5-7 days. $15k flat. No BS."
---

## How It Works

**Day 1-2:** Deep dive on your requirements. I scope the MVP, define tech stack, set clear boundaries.

**Day 3-8:** I build using Claude Code and modern AI tooling. You get daily updates.

**Day 9-10:** Deployed, tested, documented. 3-hour technical handoff (recorded). You own everything.

**After Day 10:** I'm out. You run it. No retainers, no dependency.

---

## This Is For You If:

✅ You're a funded startup (seed stage, $500k-2M+) that needs to ship FAST

✅ You can clearly define what you want to build

✅ You have someone technical who can take over after handoff

✅ You value speed over perfection

✅ You're tired of agencies that take months and charge $50k+

## This Is NOT For You If:

❌ You want ongoing support/maintenance

❌ You need help "figuring out" what to build

❌ You don't have clean data or existing infrastructure

❌ You want unlimited revisions and scope changes

❌ You're a non-tech company trying to "add AI"

## Why I'm Different

**I'm not a consultant.** I don't sell strategy decks or "AI readiness assessments."

**I'm not an agency.** I don't have designers, project managers, or overhead. Just me + Claude Code.

**I'm a builder.** 20 years of software engineering. I ship production-ready code in days, not months.

**I use AI to build AI.** Claude Code gives me 3-5x speed. I pass that speed to you.

## FAQ

**Q: Can you maintain it after delivery?**
A: No. I build and hand off. You own the code, you run it. I can recommend freelancers if needed.

**Q: What if I need changes after delivery?**
A: 2 revision rounds are included (scope-limited). After that, you're on your own or we negotiate a new scope.

**Q: What if it takes longer than 10 days?**
A: I buffer for this. If scope is properly defined, 10 days is realistic. Worst case: 12 days.

**Q: Do you sign NDAs?**
A: Yes, standard NDAs are fine.

**Q: What's your tech stack?**
A: Python/JavaScript/PHP, modern AI APIs, simple architectures. No overengineering.

**Q: Can you work with our existing codebase?**
A: Maybe. I need to review it first. If it's a mess, I'll tell you upfront (and probably decline).
