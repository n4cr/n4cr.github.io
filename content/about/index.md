**20 years building software.** J2EE monoliths, Django apps, microservices, and now AI-powered products. I've worked with small startups and large enterprises.

**Claude Code power user.** I ship production-ready code 3-5x faster than traditional development. That speed advantage goes directly to my clients.

**I prefer building over consulting.** No strategy decks. No endless meetings. Just working software delivered in days, not months.

**My stack:** Python, JavaScript, PHP. HTMX, vanilla JS. Claude Code for AI development. N8N for automation. Simple, maintainable architectures. No overengineering.

**My approach:** I only take projects I KNOW I can deliver. If your scope is unclear or your infrastructure is a mess, I'll tell you upfront and probably decline. I value honesty over sales tactics.

## What I Build

**AI MVPs:** RAG systems, chat interfaces, content pipelines, internal tools with AI features. $15k flat, 10 days.

**Business Automation:** N8N workflows that eliminate manual work in sales, ops, and customer success. $8k-12k, 5-7 days.

---

## How I Work

1. **Clear scope upfront.** I won't start without knowing exactly what we're building.
2. **Fast execution.** Using Claude Code and modern tooling to ship in days.
3. **Full handoff.** You get code, docs, and training. Then I'm out.
4. **No maintenance.** You own it, you run it.
