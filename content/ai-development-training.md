# Stop Burning Runway on Slow Engineering

## Train Your Team to Ship 3-5x Faster with AI-Powered Workflows

**For CTOs, Engineering Leaders, and Technical Founders at Funded Startups**

Your team is good. But they're too slow.

Every sprint that drags on is runway burned. Every competitor using AI workflows is shipping faster than you. Every month you wait, the gap widens.

**The problem isn't your engineers. It's their workflows.**

I'll train your team to leverage the same AI tools and workflows I use to deliver MVPs in 10 days - so they can ship features in days instead of weeks.

**Result:** 3-5x velocity gains within 30 days. Measurable ROI. No fluff.

---

## The Reality Check

You're a CTO or technical founder. Here's what you're dealing with:

- **Runway pressure:** Every slow sprint burns €50k-100k+ in salaries while competitors ship faster
- **Hiring doesn't scale:** Adding engineers takes 3-6 months and costs €100k-150k per head
- **AI hype fatigue:** Everyone talks about AI, but nobody shows you practical workflows that actually work
- **Team skepticism:** Your engineers tried Copilot, weren't impressed, and now dismiss all AI tooling

**Meanwhile, competitors using modern AI workflows are shipping 3x faster than you.**

The gap isn't talent. It's tooling and workflows.

---

## What Your Team Gets

**Immediate Velocity Gains:**
- Ship features in 3-5 days instead of 2-3 weeks
- Reduce manual deployment and testing overhead by 60-80%
- Cut time spent on boilerplate, documentation, and repetitive tasks
- Deploy multiple times per day with confidence

**Practical AI Development Skills:**
- Claude Code workflows your team will actually use daily
- MCP protocol integration for custom tool access
- When to trust AI, when to review, and how to catch mistakes
- Code review practices for AI-assisted development

**Business-Wide Automation:**
- N8N workflows that eliminate manual ops work
- Sales call intelligence and CRM automation
- Marketing content generation and campaign workflows
- Customer feedback pipelines that auto-create GitHub issues

**The ROI is Simple:**
- If one engineer saves 20 hours/month, that's €12k-15k/year value
- If your team ships one feature 2 weeks faster, what's that worth?
- If you avoid hiring 1-2 additional engineers, that's €160k-300k saved

## How It Works: Simple, Focused Sessions

Forget multi-day workshops. This is structured as focused, hands-on calls that fit into your schedule.

### The Format

**4 Sessions × 2-3 Hours Each (Remote)**

**Session 1: AI Development Foundations**
- Claude Code setup and first workflows with your codebase
- Real feature implementation (we build something live)
- Code review practices for AI-assisted development
- Your team leaves with working code

**Session 2: Automation & Deployment Workflows**
- N8N automation for your specific use cases (sales, ops, or engineering)
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD automation
- Build 2-3 automations for your business during the call
- Deploy them before we finish

**Session 3: Advanced AI Workflows**
- MCP protocol and custom tool integrations
- AI for non-code work (marketing, content, operations)
- Advanced Claude Code patterns
- Team workflow optimization for your stack

**Session 4: Implementation & Scale**
- Review what your team built between sessions
- Troubleshoot blockers and edge cases
- Build your 30-day velocity roadmap
- Q&A and ongoing support plan

---

### What's Included

**During Training:**
- 4 focused sessions (2-3 hours each) spread over 2-4 weeks
- All sessions recorded for your team
- Hands-on builds during every call (no theory-only sessions)
- Custom automations built for your business
- Direct access to me via Slack between sessions

**After Training:**
- 2 weeks of Slack support for implementation questions
- All recordings and code/workflows we built together
- Follow-up check-in call 30 days later

**Investment:** €12,000

---

### Add-On: Leadership Strategy Session

**1 Session × 2 Hours (Remote)**

For CTOs and technical founders who want strategic guidance before committing to full team training.

**What We Cover:**
- AI tooling landscape: what's useful, what's hype
- ROI analysis for your specific team size and burn rate
- Tool selection framework tailored to your stack
- Team readiness assessment
- Implementation roadmap

**Investment:** €2,000 (credited toward full training if you book within 30 days)

## This Is For You If:

✅ **You're burning runway on slow engineering** - Your team takes weeks to ship what should take days

✅ **You're a funded startup** - Seed to Series B, 5-50 engineers, €12k-15k training budget is no problem

✅ **You need velocity NOW** - Competitors are moving faster, and you can't afford to wait

✅ **You're willing to change workflows** - You'll adopt new tools if they deliver measurable results

✅ **You want hands-on training** - Not slide decks. Real code, real automations, real results

## This Is NOT For You If:

❌ **You think AI will replace your engineers** - It won't. It makes good engineers better. Bad engineers are still bad (just faster at being bad).

❌ **You're not willing to change workflows** - This requires adopting new tools and practices. If your team is rigid, this won't work.

❌ **You want a magic bullet** - AI tooling is powerful, but still requires skill, judgment, and effort. No shortcuts to quality.

❌ **You don't have technical leadership buy-in** - If your CTO/eng leads aren't on board, training will fail. Period.

---

## Why This Works (And Most Training Doesn't)

**I Build Production Software, Not Slide Decks:**
I ship MVPs in 10 days using these exact workflows. This is practitioner knowledge, not consultant theory.

**You Leave With Working Systems:**
No PowerPoints. We build automations for YOUR business during the training. You walk away with real, deployable workflows.

**ROI in 30 Days, Not 6 Months:**
Teams see 2-3x velocity gains within 30 days. If that saves even 1 engineer's salary (€80k-120k/year), this pays for itself immediately.

**Tailored to Your Reality:**
I adapt to your tech stack, team structure, and actual challenges. No generic "AI 101" content. We solve your specific bottlenecks.

**Technical Leadership Gets It:**
CTOs and engineering leaders appreciate the honest, no-BS approach. I tell you what works, what doesn't, and what's overhyped.

## FAQ

**Q: Is this just prompt engineering training?**
A: No. This is full-stack AI workflow training covering development, automation, operations, and business processes. Prompt engineering is 10% of what we cover.

**Q: Do we need to use your exact tech stack?**
A: No. I adapt to your stack. The principles and workflows work across languages and frameworks.

**Q: Will AI replace our developers?**
A: No. AI augments developers. Good engineers become 3-5x more productive. Bad engineers stay bad (but faster at being bad).

**Q: What if we're already using GitHub Copilot?**
A: Copilot is one small piece. This training covers Claude Code, MCP, N8N automations, deployment workflows, and business process automation - way beyond code completion.

**Q: Can we do this training remotely?**
A: Yes, but in-person is significantly more effective. Remote option available at 20% discount (€20k for 3-day, €32k for 4-week).

**Q: Do you offer ongoing support after training?**
A: Post-training support is included (2 weeks to 1 month depending on package). Extended support available at €3k/month.

**Q: What's the typical ROI?**
A: Teams typically see 2-3x velocity improvements within 30 days. If that saves even one developer's time (€80k/year), ROI is immediate.

**Q: Can you train non-technical teams?**
A: Yes, especially for Option 3 (Executive Crash Course) and for ops/marketing/content teams using AI for non-code work.
