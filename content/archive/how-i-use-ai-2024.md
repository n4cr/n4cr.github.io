Are you interested in learning how to effectively incorporate AI into your daily workflow? If so, read on.

I heavily rely on AI for a significant portion of my daily tasks. These tasks include automating mundane activities, coding, brainstorming, and learning about new topics. As of writing this article, there isn't a single system that covers all needs, so I often switch between different systems to accomplish my tasks. Here's a breakdown of my typical workflow.

# Claude Projects & Artifacts

For me, everything begins with a Claude Project. I generally use LLMs to help me perform existing tasks more efficiently. For any given task, I often have additional information that needs to be added to the context. This is where Claude Projects become invaluable. A project allows you to add any necessary documents, which are then included in the context of any chats within that project.

Another important feature I use is the artifacts in Claude. Artifacts are encapsulated pieces of content, code, or anything else that Claude can generate. For example, if you ask Claude to create a calculator, it writes the code and opens a functioning calculator for you, which can be shared across different projects. I use this feature frequently because it provides documents, code, and various features, and you can immediately add any of these to the context of your project.

Another example is, if I write a proposal for a project or collaborate with Claude to draft one, once I'm finished, I instruct it to add the proposal to the project's context. From then on, any other chat in that project will have the context embedded in it.
