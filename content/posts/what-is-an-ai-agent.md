Possibly, the hottest topic in AI are agents . Yet, for many, the word "agent" is quite abstract and doesn't convey much. Different interpretations of an AI agent exists and the it is being overused in the trend cycle. So here's my attempt at explaining what an AI agent is along with some examples.

I like to think of an AI agents as **a unit of intelligence persuing a particular goal**. What does that mean? It means that an agent is capable of performing a set of operation to achieve a goal and those operations require thinking. The same way that we humans think. 

Let's take an example. Suppose you want to write a blog post. Usually, writing a blog post involves multiple steps. First, you choose a topic to write about or inspired by something. Then, you may need to do some research and collect related work or ideas. Once you have enough information, you begin writing the blog post. While you're writing, you think, reflect, rephrase, reason and produce text. 

Put it simply, an AI agent can do the same thing. 

The operations are small and contained. They may require planning, reasoning, transformation or generation.
