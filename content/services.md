## Option 1: I Build For You {#build}

**MVPs, Internal Tools & Business Automations**

You need software built fast. I deliver working software with full code ownership. Usually show good results within 2-3 weeks, but timeline depends on scope.

### What I Build

**MVPs & SaaS Products:**
- Multi-user web applications
- Admin dashboards and data tools
- API integrations and platforms
- AI-powered features (RAG, chat, automation)

**Internal Tools:**
- Custom business tools and workflows
- Data processing and reporting systems
- Admin panels and management interfaces
- Integration tools connecting your systems

**Business Automations:**
- N8N workflow automation (sales, ops, marketing)
- CRM integrations (Salesforce, HubSpot)
- Document processing pipelines
- Custom Telegram/Slack bots

**Tech Stack:**
- Python, JavaScript, PHP
- Modern frameworks (Django, FastAPI, Next.js)
- SQLite, PostgreSQL
- N8N for automations
- Simple, maintainable code

### How It Works

**Phase 1:** Strategic Scoping & Foundation
- Deep dive: understand your vision & goals
- Critical thinking: what should stay, what should go
- Refine scope to the core essence
- Clear, signed scope document
- Start building core functionality

**Phase 2:** Building & Iteration
- Daily progress updates
- Mid-project demo
- You can watch progress in real-time
- 2 rounds of focused revisions

**Phase 3:** Handoff & Deployment
- Deployed to production
- 3-hour training session (recorded)
- Full code transfer

**After:** Your Success
- You own everything - full independence
- Discuss next steps or future projects
- I'm available if you need guidance

**Timeline:** Usually show good results within 2-3 weeks. Some projects take longer depending on complexity and scope.

### What You Get

- Working software deployed to production
- Full source code + comprehensive documentation
- 3-hour technical handoff session (recorded)
- 2 rounds of revisions (scope-limited)
- Deployment guide for your team
- Fixed scope, fixed price (timeline varies by complexity)

### What You Don't Get

- Ongoing support after handoff
- Strategy consulting or market research
- Unlimited scope changes
- Hand-holding for non-technical teams

### Pricing

**Discussed on call based on scope and complexity.** Projects typically range from mid-five figures depending on complexity.

**Payment Terms:**
- 50% upfront (secures your slot)
- 50% on delivery

**Availability:**
- Taking 2-3 projects per month
- Next available slot: Updated weekly

### This Is For You If:

✅ You're a funded startup (seed stage, $500k-2M+) that needs to ship FAST

✅ You can clearly define what you want to build

✅ You have someone technical who can take over after handoff

✅ You value speed over perfection

✅ You're tired of agencies that take months and charge €50k+

### This Is NOT For You If:

❌ You want ongoing support/maintenance

❌ You need help "figuring out" what to build

❌ You don't have clean data or existing infrastructure

❌ You want unlimited revisions and scope changes

❌ You're a non-tech company without technical leadership

## Option 2: I Train Your Team {#training}

**Stop Burning Runway on Slow Engineering**

Your team is good. But they're too slow. Every sprint that drags on is runway burned.

I'll train your engineering team to leverage the same AI workflows I use — so they can ship features in days instead of weeks.

**Result:** 3-5x velocity gains within 30 days. Measurable ROI.

### The Problem

You're a CTO or technical founder dealing with:

- **Runway pressure:** Every slow sprint burns €50k-100k+ in salaries while competitors ship faster
- **Hiring doesn't scale:** Adding engineers takes 3-6 months and costs €100k-150k per head
- **AI hype fatigue:** Everyone talks about AI, but nobody shows you practical workflows
- **Team skepticism:** Your engineers tried Copilot, weren't impressed, dismissed all AI tooling

**Meanwhile, competitors using modern AI workflows are shipping 3x faster than you.**

The gap isn't talent. It's tooling and workflows.

### What Your Team Gets

**Immediate Velocity Gains:**
- Ship features in 3-5 days instead of 2-3 weeks
- Reduce manual deployment and testing overhead by 60-80%
- Cut time spent on boilerplate, documentation, and repetitive tasks
- Deploy multiple times per day with confidence

**Practical AI Development Skills:**
- Claude Code workflows your team will actually use daily
- MCP protocol integration for custom tool access
- When to trust AI, when to review, and how to catch mistakes
- Code review practices for AI-assisted development

**Business-Wide Automation:**
- N8N workflows that eliminate manual ops work
- Sales call intelligence and CRM automation
- Marketing content generation and campaign workflows
- Customer feedback pipelines that auto-create GitHub issues

**The ROI is Simple:**
- If one engineer saves 20 hours/month, that's €12k-15k/year value
- If your team ships one feature 2 weeks faster, what's that worth?
- If you avoid hiring 1-2 additional engineers, that's €160k-300k saved

### Training Format

**4 Sessions × 2-3 Hours Each (Remote)**

Forget multi-day workshops. This is structured as focused, hands-on calls that fit into your schedule.

**Session 1: AI Development Foundations**
- Claude Code setup and first workflows with your codebase
- Real feature implementation (we build something live)
- Code review practices for AI-assisted development
- Your team leaves with working code

**Session 2: Automation & Deployment Workflows**
- N8N automation for your specific use cases (sales, ops, or engineering)
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD automation
- Build 2-3 automations for your business during the call
- Deploy them before we finish

**Session 3: Advanced AI Workflows**
- MCP protocol and custom tool integrations
- AI for non-code work (marketing, content, operations)
- Advanced Claude Code patterns
- Team workflow optimization for your stack

**Session 4: Implementation & Scale**
- Review what your team built between sessions
- Troubleshoot blockers and edge cases
- Build your 30-day velocity roadmap
- Q&A and ongoing support plan

### What's Included

**During Training:**
- 4 focused sessions (2-3 hours each) spread over 2-4 weeks
- All sessions recorded for your team
- Hands-on builds during every call (no theory-only sessions)
- Custom automations built for your business
- Direct access to me via Slack between sessions

**After Training:**
- 2 weeks of Slack support for implementation questions
- All recordings and code/workflows we built together
- Follow-up check-in call 30 days later

### Pricing

**€12,000**

**What's Included:**
- 4 hands-on training sessions (2-3 hours each)
- Spread over 2-4 weeks, remote
- Up to 10 participants
- All sessions recorded
- Custom automations built during calls
- 2 weeks Slack support
- 30-day follow-up call

**Payment:**
- 50% upfront to secure dates
- 50% after session 2

**Availability:**
- Taking 2-3 companies per month
- Book 2-3 weeks in advance

### This Is For You If:

✅ **You're burning runway on slow engineering** - Your team takes weeks to ship what should take days

✅ **You're a funded startup** - Seed to Series B, 5-50 engineers, €12k training budget is no problem

✅ **You need velocity NOW** - Competitors are moving faster, and you can't afford to wait

✅ **You're willing to change workflows** - You'll adopt new tools if they deliver measurable results

✅ **You want hands-on training** - Not slide decks. Real code, real automations, real results

### This Is NOT For You If:

❌ **You think AI will replace your engineers** - It won't. It makes good engineers better.

❌ **You're not willing to change workflows** - This requires adopting new tools and practices.

❌ **You want a magic bullet** - AI tooling is powerful, but still requires skill, judgment, and effort.

❌ **You don't have technical leadership buy-in** - If your CTO/eng leads aren't on board, training will fail.

### Why This Works

**I Build Production Software, Not Slide Decks:**
I ship MVPs in 2-3 weeks using these exact workflows. This is practitioner knowledge, not consultant theory.

**You Leave With Working Systems:**
No PowerPoints. We build automations for YOUR business during the training. You walk away with real, deployable workflows.

**ROI in 30 Days, Not 6 Months:**
Teams see 2-3x velocity gains within 30 days. If that saves even 1 engineer's salary (€80k-120k/year), this pays for itself immediately.

**Tailored to Your Reality:**
I adapt to your tech stack, team structure, and actual challenges. No generic "AI 101" content.

## FAQ

**Q: Can you maintain software after delivery?**
A: No. I build and hand off. You own the code, you run it. I can recommend freelancers if needed.

**Q: What if I need changes after delivery?**
A: 2 revision rounds are included (scope-limited). After that, you're on your own or we negotiate a new scope.

**Q: Do you sign NDAs?**
A: Yes, standard NDAs are fine.

**Q: Can you work with our existing codebase?**
A: Maybe. I need to review it first. If it's a mess, I'll tell you upfront (and probably decline).

**Q: Is training remote or in-person?**
A: Remote. All sessions are conducted via video call and recorded.

**Q: Do we need to use your exact tech stack for training?**
A: No. I adapt to your stack. The principles and workflows work across languages and frameworks.

**Q: Will AI replace our developers?**
A: No. AI augments developers. Good engineers become 3-5x more productive. Bad engineers stay bad (but faster at being bad).

**Q: What's the typical ROI for training?**
A: Teams typically see 2-3x velocity improvements within 30 days. If that saves even one developer's time (€80k/year), ROI is immediate.
