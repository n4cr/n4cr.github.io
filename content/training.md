# Train Your Team

**Stop Burning Runway on Slow Engineering**

Your team is good. But they're too slow. Every sprint that drags on is runway burned.

I'll train your engineering team to leverage the same AI workflows I use — so they can ship features in days instead of weeks.

**Result:** 3-5x velocity gains within 30 days. Measurable ROI.

---

## The Problem

You're a CTO or technical founder dealing with:

- **Runway pressure:** Every slow sprint burns €50k-100k+ in salaries while competitors ship faster
- **Hiring doesn't scale:** Adding engineers takes 3-6 months and costs €100k-150k per head
- **AI hype fatigue:** Everyone talks about AI, but nobody shows you practical workflows
- **Team skepticism:** Your engineers tried Copilot, weren't impressed, dismissed all AI tooling

**Meanwhile, competitors using modern AI workflows are shipping 3x faster than you.**

The gap isn't talent. It's tooling and workflows.

---

## What Your Team Gets

**Immediate Velocity Gains:**
- Ship features in 3-5 days instead of 2-3 weeks
- Reduce manual deployment and testing overhead by 60-80%
- Cut time spent on boilerplate, documentation, and repetitive tasks
- Deploy multiple times per day with confidence

**Practical AI Development Skills:**
- Claude Code workflows your team will actually use daily
- MCP protocol integration for custom tool access
- When to trust AI, when to review, and how to catch mistakes
- Code review practices for AI-assisted development

**Business-Wide Automation:**
- N8N workflows that eliminate manual ops work
- Sales call intelligence and CRM automation
- Marketing content generation and campaign workflows
- Customer feedback pipelines that auto-create GitHub issues

**The ROI is Simple:**
- If one engineer saves 20 hours/month, that's €12k-15k/year value
- If your team ships one feature 2 weeks faster, what's that worth?
- If you avoid hiring 1-2 additional engineers, that's €160k-300k saved

## Training Format

**4 Sessions × 2-3 Hours Each (Remote)**

Forget multi-day workshops. This is structured as focused, hands-on calls that fit into your schedule.

**Session 1: AI Development Foundations**
- Claude Code setup and first workflows with your codebase
- Real feature implementation (we build something live)
- Code review practices for AI-assisted development
- Your team leaves with working code

**Session 2: Automation & Deployment Workflows**
- N8N automation for your specific use cases (sales, ops, or engineering)
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD automation
- Build 2-3 automations for your business during the call
- Deploy them before we finish

**Session 3: Advanced AI Workflows**
- MCP protocol and custom tool integrations
- AI for non-code work (marketing, content, operations)
- Advanced Claude Code patterns
- Team workflow optimization for your stack

**Session 4: Implementation & Scale**
- Review what your team built between sessions
- Troubleshoot blockers and edge cases
- Build your 30-day velocity roadmap
- Q&A and ongoing support plan

---

## What's Included

**During Training:**
- 4 focused sessions (2-3 hours each) spread over 2-4 weeks
- All sessions recorded for your team
- Hands-on builds during every call (no theory-only sessions)
- Custom automations built for your business
- Direct access to me via Slack between sessions

**After Training:**
- 2 weeks of Slack support for implementation questions
- All recordings and code/workflows we built together
- Follow-up check-in call 30 days later

## How We Start: Discovery Call

Before we discuss pricing or format, let's understand your team and find the opportunities.

**On our discovery call, we'll discuss:**

**Your Current Workflows:**
- How does your team operate today?
- Where are the bottlenecks?
- What's working, what's not?

**Transformation Opportunities:**
- Where can AI-augmented workflows make the biggest impact?
- Which processes are ripe for change?
- What's the low-hanging fruit?

**My Approach:**
- Rethink workflows from specification to delivery
- Start with high-impact, low-risk changes
- Gradually transform team processes
- Build momentum with early wins

**What This Requires:**

This isn't just about engineers learning new tools. It requires:

- **Engineers:** Open to AI-augmented development and new workflows
- **Designers:** Willing to understand more of the technical implementation
- **Product Owners:** Ready to engage more directly with the development process

The roles become more intertwined. Engineers need to understand product thinking. Designers need to grasp technical constraints. Product owners need to be closer to the code.

**This is a team transformation, not just a training program.**

After our call, I'll propose a specific format, timeline, and pricing tailored to your team's needs and opportunities.

## This Is For You If:

✅ **You're burning runway on slow engineering** - Your team takes weeks to ship what should take days

✅ **You're a funded startup** - Seed to Series B, 5-50 engineers, €12k training budget is no problem

✅ **You need velocity NOW** - Competitors are moving faster, and you can't afford to wait

✅ **You're willing to change workflows** - You'll adopt new tools if they deliver measurable results

✅ **You want hands-on training** - Not slide decks. Real code, real automations, real results

---

## This Is NOT For You If:

❌ **You think AI will replace your engineers** - It won't. It makes good engineers better.

❌ **You're not willing to change workflows** - This requires adopting new tools and practices.

❌ **You want a magic bullet** - AI tooling is powerful, but still requires skill, judgment, and effort.

❌ **You don't have technical leadership buy-in** - If your CTO/eng leads aren't on board, training will fail.

---

## Why This Works

**I Build Production Software, Not Slide Decks:**
I ship MVPs in 2-3 weeks using these exact workflows. This is practitioner knowledge, not consultant theory.

**You Leave With Working Systems:**
No PowerPoints. We build automations for YOUR business during the training. You walk away with real, deployable workflows.

**ROI in 30 Days, Not 6 Months:**
Teams see 2-3x velocity gains within 30 days. If that saves even 1 engineer's salary (€80k-120k/year), this pays for itself immediately.

**Tailored to Your Reality:**
I adapt to your tech stack, team structure, and actual challenges. No generic "AI 101" content.
