I've been watching engineering teams for 20 years. The difference between fast and slow teams isn't talent.

Early in my career, I worked with brilliant engineers—PhDs, former Google employees, people who could solve complex problems in their sleep. We moved slowly. Features took months.

Later, I joined a startup. The team was good, but not exceptional. We shipped faster than any team I'd worked with. Features went from idea to production in days.

What was the difference?

The fast team had clarity about what they were building and why. More importantly, they had removed everything that stood between a decision and seeing it in production. The slow team spent most of their time coordinating, waiting, and working around their own processes.

I've seen this pattern repeat dozens of times. Team speed has little to do with how smart the engineers are. It has everything to do with how much friction exists between intent and execution.

The real friction is in the waiting. Waiting for code review. Waiting for QA. Waiting for deployment. Waiting for decisions. Most engineering work follows a pattern: brief bursts of creation interrupted by long periods of waiting and context switching.

I watched a senior engineer wait two days for a code review on a small change. The review took fifteen minutes. Those two days weren't the reviewer's fault—they were just busy. But the cost was real. Context was lost. Momentum died.

About eighteen months ago, I started using AI-augmented workflows. Not because of the hype, but curiosity about reducing friction. The results surprised me. Not because AI writes perfect code—it doesn't—but because it eliminates waiting time.

When I'm building now, I'm rarely blocked. Claude Code drafts functions while I think about the next piece. Tests are generated as I review. I have an immediate feedback loop instead of waiting days.

The effect compounds. When you see results immediately, you learn faster. You make better decisions because you're testing assumptions in real-time.

I've been helping other teams adopt similar workflows. What I've learned is that the tools are only part of the solution. The harder part is helping teams recognize where the friction lives and why they've accepted it as normal.

After two decades, I believe velocity comes from three things:

Reducing time between decision and feedback. Eliminating coordination overhead. Automating everything that doesn't require human judgment.

If your team is moving slower than you'd like, the answer probably isn't hiring more people. It's examining where the friction lives and systematically eliminating it.

I help teams do this through hands-on training. We examine your workflows, identify bottlenecks, and build automations that eliminate them. Most teams see measurable improvements within a month.

The teams that move fast in 2025 won't be the ones with the most talented engineers. They'll be the ones who figured out how to remove friction between intent and execution.
